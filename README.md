# CatchGPT

CatchGPT is a tool that can determine if a particular text is written by an AI or a human being through analyzing the text's average perplexity per line score and its burstiness.

In general, **perplexity** is the measurement of how likely the model is able to predict the next word in an input text sequence. This is often used to guage the performance of a natural language processing model. Texts with a high perplexity value are generally written by humans, while AI generated text typically have lower perplexity values. 

Additionally, in our case, **burstiness** refers to the variation (standard deviation was used in this implementation) in perplexity per sentence/line. Typically, humans tend to write in a "bursty fashion" as we would generally have short sentences mixed in with long sentences. On the other hand, NLP models typically write in a "uniform fashion" where almost all sentences have a similar length. Thus, text generated by AI's such as ChatGPT, YouChat, Bing Search, and others, will have have lower values of burstiness in comparison to a human-written text.
